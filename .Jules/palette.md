## 2024-05-22 - Single File Project Structure
**Learning:** This project consists of a single `index.html` file with no build system or package manager. This limits the ability to use automated linting/testing tools but simplifies deployment.
**Action:** Future UX improvements should focus on vanilla HTML/JS/CSS solutions and rely on manual verification or lightweight script-based testing if needed. Avoid adding dependencies unless necessary.
