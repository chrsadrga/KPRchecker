# Palette's Journal

## 2025-10-26 - Initial Assessment
**Learning:** This project lacks a standard build system and relies on a single HTML file with embedded scripts. UX improvements must be lightweight and implementation-focused within this single file structure.
**Action:** Prioritize inline accessibility fixes and micro-interactions that don't require external dependencies.

## 2025-10-26 - Currency Input UX
**Learning:** For large numeric inputs (like property prices), users struggle to count zeros.
**Action:** If full input masking is too complex/risky for a quick fix, providing a real-time "formatted preview" next to the label is a low-risk, high-value alternative.
