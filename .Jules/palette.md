**Learning:** Even single-file prototypes often miss fundamental accessibility links like `label for=""`. This breaks the experience for screen reader users and reduces click targets for everyone.
**Action:** Always check label-input associations first, even before complex ARIA patterns. It's a "invisible" fix that makes the app feel more solid (clicking label focuses input).
